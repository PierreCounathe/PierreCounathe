# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here is a list of ongoing and past projects I've been working on during my free time.

## Ongoing projects

- **gym-routing** [`rl`, `graphs`]: Solving the Traveling Salesman Prolem with `gym` and `stable-baselines3` [repo](https://github.com/PierreCounathe/gym-routing)
- **simple-implementations** [`llm`, `computer-vision`]: Implementing ML and DL concepts (Transformer, LoRA, NeRF) from scratch [repo](https://github.com/PierreCounathe/simple-implementations)

## Previous Projects

- **nim-rl** [`rl`]: Using `numpy` only, training an agent to master the Nim Game [repo](https://github.com/PierreCounathe/Reinforcement-Learning-for-Nim-Game)
- **Frequency-GANs** [`gan`]: Generate market-specific financial time series using GANs acting in the frequency domain [repo](https://github.com/PierreCounathe/Financial-Time-Series-Generation-Frequency-GANs)
- **Droughts Forecasting** [`lstm`]: Forecast droughts in the US with a 6-week lead time using weather time series and static soil data [repo](https://github.com/PierreCounathe/Droughts-Forecasting)
- **Image Completion** [`gan`]: This model can effectively replace a nose or an eye on faces, and fill missing parts of portraits [repo](https://github.com/PierreCounathe/Globally-and-Locally-Consistent-Image-Completion-Pytorch-Implementation)
- **Dynamic Pricing Optimization** [`ml`, `optimization`]: Optimize Real Estate prices dynamically to meet financial constraints and deadlines (loan repayment dates) and maximize revenues [repo](https://github.com/PierreCounathe/Real-Estate-Pricing-Optimization-Under-Financial-Constraints)
